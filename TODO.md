=====================================

- [ ] Finder and Formatters such as opus/opusFinder, greek/greekFinder should be moved to another file and use a common finder function except for the lowest level 
- [Â ] The text is scrambled for some reason, we should have a look to know if this has to do with lxml. Maybe go back to formatting xml with string directly... ?
- [ ] Secondary sources using *in/im* and not quoting any primary source are not put into `<bibl>`
